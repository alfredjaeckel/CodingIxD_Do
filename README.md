# CodingIxD_Do

We have a Flask based webapplication for managing a ToDo-List. The Projects main goal was to help people who procrastinate with the emphasis on goals without deadlines. For that we have a system, where you can prioritize up to 3 tasks. 
Every prioritized task has a countdown that runs for a week. The code is then running a python script to turn a stepper motor for that perios of time. 
After the time runs up you then will be prompted to make an easier goal, if you have not completed the task.
